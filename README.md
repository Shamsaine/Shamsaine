# __Hi there I'm Shamsudeen Ibrahim👋__

# __Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Software Engineer (in the Making ☺)__

I am an aspiring problem solver. I know it sounds crazy but ive always wanted to be a solution provider (A jack of all trade if you would call it that). I thought it was just a fantasy until i got into technology and realise the unlimited potential and opportunities available to me and a path it provided me to make  my dream come true. And so my journey began. In a space of three years i was able to dabble and gain knowledge in the in various filed from Data analysis to data science, machine learning and Artificial intelligence, Backend web development, and currently software engineering. In the course of my journey i have gained skills in Html, CSS, Python, R, SQL and currently C programming language and JavaScript and how to apply these skills to solve problems in the fields ive mentioned. ive also being able to familiarize my self with tools such as Excel, MySQL and other database management tools, visulalisation tools such as tableau and PowerBI, and machine learning tools like pandas Numpy Scikitlearn and a host of others too. 


I’m currently working on some personal projects for my portfolio to practice and sharpen my skills and also to document my journey so far, learning C programming with @ALX_AFRICA and sharpening my skills in Data science and machine learning with WorldQuant University. 
Also exploring more opportunities to showcase my skills in a formidable environment through project collaborations, internship, jobs or simply just connecting and sharing ideas that would facilitate our growth and development.
