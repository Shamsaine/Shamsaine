an aspiring problem solver. i know it sounds crazy but ive always wanted to be a problem solver or a solution provider. A jack of all trade not because i try to master the all but because my passion for problem solving and love of versatility has lead me to pick up many skills and develop interest in alot of areas. this coupled with my curiosity and love for growth is what has kept me going and has brought me this far in the technological space even though i started my journey just three years ago i have been able to ganer certifications in various field and still working to upskill and gain more specialization and increase my versatility and range. i dont want to be kept in a box limited by my skills or be outside the box detached from the space i love so much i want to be the box.
